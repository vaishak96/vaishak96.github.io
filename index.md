#### [DoorDash Project](https://medium.com/@vaishakda9000/evolving-consumer-trends-in-food-delivery-an-in-depth-analysis-of-doordash-08c624f01c51)
[<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*SSItDWV_jmcXDa7oVHia0A.jpeg"/>](https://medium.com/@vaishakda9000/evolving-consumer-trends-in-food-delivery-an-in-depth-analysis-of-doordash-08c624f01c51)
The article analyses consumer trends in the food delivery industry, focusing on DoorDash. It highlights key demographics and spending behaviours, showing that higher-income customers use the service more frequently, and households without children spend more. The analysis also suggests that strategic marketing, such as targeted promotions and menu options, can help DoorDash optimise customer satisfaction and retention. For educational purposes, the project uses a dataset derived from iFood's case study.!

#### [HR Attrition Project](https://medium.com/@vaishakda9000/comprehensive-analysis-of-hr-attrition-exploring-key-drivers-of-employee-turnover-ae588c17fe58)
[<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*5-Xqi0i3yxs1Alue"/>](https://medium.com/@vaishakda9000/comprehensive-analysis-of-hr-attrition-exploring-key-drivers-of-employee-turnover-ae588c17fe58)
The article comprehensively analyses employee attrition, focusing on key factors influencing turnover, such as age, tenure, gender, overtime, job roles, and commute distance. Using a dataset from IBM, the study reveals that younger employees and those working overtime are likelier to leave, while tenure and gender have little impact on turnover. Roles like laboratory technicians and sales representatives face the highest attrition rates. Recommendations include managing overtime and offering flexible work arrangements to improve retention.
